# Linear_Regression_Ecommerce_Customers
Linear regression predicting how much money a customer will spend online depending on if they use the companies website or app. 

Data from Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp on Udemy.com.

Fake data set from an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 



Based on this analysis, people spending more time on the App are more likely to spend more money. The company can focus on encouraging people to use their app rather than the website, or they can focus on improving their ineffective website.

It should be noted that the coefficient with the largest impact on money spent is "Length of Membership". Attracting new members could be a priority as well.
